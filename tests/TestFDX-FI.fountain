INT. RADIO STUDIO #1#

We are in a TV station listening to the announcer on the other site of the glass.

DJ
(bored)
Hey everyone, this is some music that sounds kinda terrible.

Dave is at the coffee machine.

DAVE
Why do we pay him?

JIM (O.S.)
Because he helps us test this screenplay.

CUT TO:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE FOOD STORE #2#

We are standing outside the food store. Kay is looking at the posters in the window.

KAY
Maybe there's a job for me here.
